MarketPlace-Java-RMI is a client server distributed application developed in Java
for trading things (items) on a networked marketplace.
Clients ared traders and server monitor the marketplance.
they are communiating usnig Remote Method Invocation using Java RMI.
A server represents the marketplace and provides a remote interface that allows clients to (un)register at the marketplace, 
to sell (i.e. to place items for sale) and to buy items, and to inspect what items are available on the marketplace.
